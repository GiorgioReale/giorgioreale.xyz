# giorgioreale.xyz

This repository contains the source code for the [giorgioreale.xyz](https://giorgioreale.xyz/) and [cv.giorgioreale.xyz](https://cv.giorgioreale.xyz/) websites. These websites were built using a combination of technologies, including Docker, Nginx, PHP, and Node, to provide a fast and seamless browsing experience for site visitors. The sites were designed to showcase my portfolio, skills, projects, and work experience. The code is available on GitHub so that others can see how I created the site and use it as a starting point for their own projects.
